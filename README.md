Calculator

Basic Calculator based on macOS visual. Here I'm trying to work with Observers and Although the first though is to make it responsive by mouse, I'll add some kind of "keyboard listener" too.

* Just tried some design and the calculator already has it's macOS charm.

* Cleaned the design of the calculator, did minimum adjustments and it's looking even greater! Now let's go to the functional part!

* The Calculator is functional and ready to be used, I'm happy to say the v1 has been released and make sure to have Java SDK updated in your machine. I am soon implementing JUnit testcases to give the project some confiability
